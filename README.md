# Myntra-Analytics-Dashboard

Hii I am Shubham Sharma
An aspiring data analyst, I applied my SQL, Python (Pandas , Matplotlib), and Power BI
Skills to analyze Myntra’s sales and pricing data, uncovering key business insights to support data-driven decision-making.

-- Business Problem --

Myntra, like any growing e-commerce platform, faces a few big questions. Are the discounts it gives really helping sales, or just cutting into profits? Are customers truly satisfied across categories, sizes, and price ranges—or are some areas letting them down? Some brands are thriving, while others survive only on heavy discounts—so how do we measure real brand strength? On the inventory side, Myntra often ends up with slow-moving products sitting unsold while fast-sellers risk running out of stock. And finally, which categories and customer segments—men, women, or specific styles—are actually driving the most engagement and growth? These are the problems I focused on solving through data.

-- Analysis --

For this project, I started by exploring and cleaning the Myntra dataset using SQL. Then, with the help of Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, I analyzed the data to uncover meaningful patterns. Finally, I brought everything together in Power BI, where I built an interactive dashboard to turn those numbers into easy-to-understand insights that connect directly to real business problems.

-- Analysis Report --

Pricing & Discounts – Discounts are clearly working to attract shoppers, but some brands are leaning on them a bit too much. That may win sales in the short term, but it risks eating into profitability. We also found products that are overpriced compared to their category average—suggesting Myntra needs a smarter, more balanced pricing approach.


Customer Satisfaction – The overall average rating is 4.1/5, but categories like footwear fall to 3.6, signaling quality or fit issues. Size analysis revealed that “M” sizes perform 10% better in ratings compared to “XS” or “XL,” suggesting fit inconsistency.


Brand Performance – The top 5 brands contribute nearly 40% of SKUs, while smaller brands rely on >50% average discounts to drive sales. Premium brands with ratings above 4.5 manage to sell with <10% discount, proving brand trust reduces price pressure.


Inventory Optimization – Roughly 18% of products are slow-moving (low reviews & low ratings), while the top 10% fast movers account for nearly 45% of customer reviews. This imbalance shows the need for sharper stock planning.


Category Trends & Engagement – Women’s products make up 65% of total SKUs, but men’s products are growing at ~15% year-on-year. Categories like t-shirts and dresses generate the highest engagement, with 20K+ reviews each, highlighting strong customer attention.
